## Compiling and Running


If you have intellij, do 'File > open' and then navigate to the folder for this project. Open the 'RSA' file and click the green
arrow next to the 'runGetGToTheAModP' method to get p and g^a % p. You can change the fields for g a and p at the top of the file. In the 
'runGetGToTheABModP' method, modify the field for gbModP with the return g^b % p and click the green arrow to get g^(a*b) % p. This is the
key for decrypting the file.
