## Compiling and Running


If you have intellij, do 'File > open' and then navigate to the folder for this project. Open the 'RSA' file and click the green
arrow next to the 'generateParameters' method to get p, q, n, e and d. 

If the green arrow isn't their then you're probably missing the junit dependency. If you put your curser on the '@Test' tag and
hit alt+enter you'll see an option to add junit to the classpath. This should fix the problem

To perform the encryption modify the fields with the previously generated paramenters in the 'encrypt' method. Same goes for 
decryption in the 'decrypt' method.
